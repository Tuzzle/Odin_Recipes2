<h2>This is my personal spin on the classic New York Style Cheesecake.</h2>
<body>I pulled from multiple other recipes and my own personal tastebuds to figure out what, in my opinion, is the best tasting cheesecake ever!</body>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h5>For Crust</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, from 12 crackers</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h5>For Filling</h5>
<ul>
    <li>32 oz cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 cups sugar</li>
    <li>3 table spoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon packed lemon zest, from 1 lemon</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon jucie, from 1 lemon</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>SPECIAL EQUIPMENT: 10-inch springform pan; 18-inch heavy duty aluminum foil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375</li>
    <li>Wrap the springform pan with one large piece of the heavy-duty aluminm foil. Make sure there are no seams and it extends all the way to the top of the pan</li>
    <li>Spray the inside of the pan with nonstick cooking spray</li>
    <li>For the crust: Combine graham cracker crumbers, melted butter, sugar and salt. Stir until well combined.</li>
    <li>Press the crumbs into an even layer on the bottom of the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until set. Remove pan from the oven and set aside</li>
    <li>Lower oven temp to 325 and boil some water.</li>
    <li>Make the batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or beaters, beat the cream cheese, sugar, and flour together on medium speed until just smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure the mixture is evenly combined. Add the vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt; beat on low speed until just combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until incorporated, scraping the bowl as necessary. Mix in the sour cream. Make sure the batter is uniform but do not over-mix.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter on top of the crust. Pour the boiling water into the large roasting pan to come about 1 inch up the side of the cake pan. Bake until the cake is just set, 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. (If the cheesecake starts to look too golden on top towards the end, cover it loosely with foil.) The cake should not look liquidy at all but will wobble just a bit when the pan is nudged; it will continue to cook as it cools. Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Cool the cheesecake in the water bath until the water is just warm, about 45 minutes. Remove the springform pan from the water bath and discard the foil. If necessary, run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the cake to make sure it's not sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as it cools), then cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to cool for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
