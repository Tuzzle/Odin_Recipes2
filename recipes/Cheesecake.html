<h2>This is my personal spin on the classic New York Style Cheesecake.</h2>
<body>I pulled from multiple other recipes and my own personal tastebuds to figure out what, in my opinion, is the best tasting cheesecake ever!</body>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h5>For Crust</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, from 12 crackers</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h5>For Filling</h5>
<ul>
    <li>32 oz cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 cups sugar</li>
    <li>3 table spoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon packed lemon zest, from 1 lemon</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon jucie, from 1 lemon</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>SPECIAL EQUIPMENT: 10-inch springform pan; 18-inch heavy duty aluminum foil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375</li>
    <li>Wrap the springform pan with one large piece of the heavy-duty aluminm foil. Make sure there are no seams and it extends all the way to the top of the pan</li>
    <li>Spray the inside of the pan with nonstick cooking spray</li>
    <li>For the crust: Combine graham cracker crumbers, melted butter, sugar and salt. Stir until well combined.</li>
    <li>Press the crumbs into an even layer on the bottom of the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until set. Remove pan from the oven and set aside</li>
    <li>Lower oven temp to 325 and boil some water.</li>
    <li>Make the batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or beaters, beat the cream cheese, sugar, and flour together on medium speed until just smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure the mixture is evenly combined. Add the vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt; beat on low speed until just combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until incorporated, scraping the bowl as necessary. Mix in the sour cream. Make sure the batter is uniform but do not over-mix.</li>
